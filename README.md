# Hypixel Bedwars Stat Tracker Website

A website where Hypixel Bedwars players can view their stats through gamemode specific cards and informational graphs. Made with React.js, Chart.js, HTML, and CSS.

As of now, my API key and the Hypixel API only allows 1 of the same Minecraft account search per minute. This is super annoying as if someone refreshes my website's page when theyre viewing a profile, the API will send the data again for another minute. I dont want to learn databases for this project but I know that could be an option. I could also use multiple API keys but that is against the Hypixel API policies. 

This is the first time I worked with React Router without mindlessly following a tutorial on Youtube. I learned how to use React Hooks as well as use an API key to get information from an API (in this case it is (Hypixel's Public API)[https://api.hypixel.net/]). I also like to think I got a bit better with my HTML and CSS Responsive layout skills, however I'm aware that they still need losts of work. This was also the first time I used Chart.js and fortunately the (documentation)[https://www.chartjs.org/] was super helpful. I also think I could have made the code more efficient (especially the way I assigned API data to arrays) so maybe I'll come back and clean up the code once I become more skilled in React.js and Javascript and programming in general.
